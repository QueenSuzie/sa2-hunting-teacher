# Project Title

This project aims to help new SA2 runners learn hunting pieces efficiently.

## Description

Normally new runners to SA2 face a daunting task for learning all of the emerald pieces in the game reuquired to effectively run either of the 2 story modes that make up the 2 most popular categories.
This processes generally involves spending countless hours grinding each individual hunting stage over and over until the player feels as though they've learned all of the possible pieces in that stage and there truly are no shortcuts.
Even then it's possible (and indeed very common) that one or two very rare pieces could have slipped through the cracks of this process.
So I developed this project to aid new players in learning their pieces by playing through a curated list of sets that guarantees the player will not only see every single possible piece in the stage, but also that they will do so as efficiently as possible
without any unnecessarily repeated sets.
